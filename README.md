# üß¨ Mysterious Organism
Mysterious Organism is a challenge project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer Career Path. It is a JavaScript program that utilises Javascript objects to simulate the DNA of a fictional organism called Pila aequor (P. aequor), which comprises only 15 DNA bases. The starter code included two helper functions: **``returnRandBase()``** which randomly returns one of four DNA bases, and **``mockUpStrand()``** which returns a random single strand of DNA containing 15 bases.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To install my solution to the Mysterious Organism project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using **``git clone https://github.com/mary-brooks/mysterious-organism.git``**
2. Open the project directory in your code editor of choice.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Usage
To use my solution to the Mysterious Organism project, follow these steps:

1. Open the **``main.js``** file in your code editor.
2. Create new instances of pAequor using the **``pAequorFactory()``** factory function. 
3. Access the **``mutate()``** method on an instance of pAequor to mutate a random base in it's DNA.
4. Access the **``compareDNA()``** method on an instance of pAequor and pass another instance as an argument to compare the DNA of the two objects and return a percentage of similarity. 
5. Access the **``willLikelySurvive()``** method on an instance of pAequor to determine whether or not it is likely to survive.  

## ‚≠ê Features
My solution to the Mysterious Organism project has the following features:

- Creates new instances of the pAequor object with a given specimen number and DNA array
- Mutates a random base in the organism's DNA
- Compares the DNA of two pAequor objects and returns the percentage of DNA bases that are the same 
- Checks if an instance of pAequor is likely to survive based on the percentage of CG bases in its DNA
- Generates 30 instances of pAequor which are likely to survive and stores them in an array
